 * file: EmptyFrame1.java
 *
 * Synopsis:
 *  This continues the EmptyFrame.java saga.
 *	To allow the program to terminate properly, we
 *	introduce a class "Terminator"
 *	to implement the "WindowListener".  Then when we close
 *	the window, an instance of this class will catch the
 *	"close" message!  However, it is tedious to implement
 *	WindowListeners as it has 7 methods to implement.  Instead
 *	Java provides the class WindowAdaptor which implements
 *	WindowListener with all 7 methods defaulted to the null
 *	implementation.  You just need to extend WindowAdaptor
 *	to implement any of the 7 methods that is relevant to you.
 *	In the present example, we only implement the windowClosing
 *	method! In the following example, we further simplify this
 *	by implementing an anonymous extension of WindowAdaptor().

	} );

/* NOTES:
	WindowAdapter() is class that implements WindowListers
	with null methods for all the 7 methods of WindowListeners!
	It is found in java.awt.event.*.
